pinact is a CLI to edit GitHub Workflow and Composite action files and pin versions of Actions and Reusable Workflows.
pinact can also [update their versions](#update-actions) and [verify version annotations](docs/codes/001.md).

```sh
pinact run
```

## Motivation

It is a good manner to pin GitHub Actions versions by commit hash.
GitHub tags are mutable so they have a substantial security and reliability risk.

See also [Security hardening for GitHub Actions - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions)

> Pinning an action to a full length commit SHA is currently the only way to use an action as an immutable release.
> Pinning to a particular SHA helps mitigate the risk of a bad actor adding a backdoor to the action's repository, as they would need to generate a SHA-1 collision for a valid Git object payload

## Why not using Renovate's helpers:pinGitHubActionDigestsToSemver preset?

The Renovate preset [helpers:pinGitHubActionDigestsToSemver](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-helpers/#helperspingithubactiondigeststosemver) is useful, but pinact is still useful:

1. Renovate can't pin actions in pull requests before merging them.
If you use linters such as [ghalint](https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/ghalint) in CI, you need to pin actions before merging pull requests
(ref. [ghalint policy to enforce actions to be pinned](https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/ghalint/blob/main/docs/policies/008.md))
2. Even if you use Renovate, sometimes you would want to update actions manually
3. pinact is useful for non Renovate users
4. [pinact supports verifying version annotations](https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/pinact/blob/main/docs/codes/001.md)

## GitHub Access token

pinact calls GitHub REST API to get commit hashes and tags.
You can pass GitHub Access token via environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
If no GitHub Access token is passed, pinact calls GitHub REST API without access token.

## How to use

Please run `pinact run` on a Git repository root directory, then target files are fixed.

```sh
pinact run
```

Default target files are:

```
.github/workflows/*.yml
.github/workflows/*.yaml
action.yml
action.yaml
*/action.yml
*/action.yaml
*/*/action.yml
*/*/action.yaml
*/*/*/action.yml
*/*/*/action.yaml
```

You can change target files by command line arguments or configuration files.

e.g.

```sh
pinact run example.yaml
```

### Update actions

[#663](https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/pinact/pull/663) pinact >= v1.1.0

You can update actions using the `-update (-u)` option:

```sh
pinact run -u
```

### Fix example codes in documents

pinact can fix example codes in documents too.

```sh
pinact run README.md
```

### Generate a configuration file `.pinact.yaml`

A configuration file is optional.
You can create a configuration file `.pinact.yaml` by `pinact init`.

```sh
pinact init
```

You can change the output path.

```sh
pinact init '.github/pinact.yaml'
```

About the configuration, please see [Configuration](#Configuration).

### Validation

`pinact >= v1.6.0` [#816](https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/pinact/pull/816)

Instead of fixing files, you can validate if actions are pinned by `--check` option:

```sh
pinact run --check
```

Using this option, pinact doesn't fix files.
If actions aren't pinned, the command fails.

```console
$ pinact run --check
ERRO[0000] parse a line                                  action=actions/checkout@v2 error="action isn't pinned" pinact_version= program=pinact workflow_file=testdata/foo.yaml
ERRO[0000] parse a line                                  action=actions/cache@v3.3.1 error="action isn't pinned" pinact_version= program=pinact workflow_file=testdata/foo.yaml

ERRO[0000] parse a line                                  action=suzuki-shunsuke/actionlint-workflow/.github/workflows/actionlint.yaml@v0.5.0 error="action isn't pinned" pinact_version= program=pinact workflow_file=testdata/foo.yaml

$ echo $?
1
```

### Verify version annotations

Please see [the document](docs/codes/001.md).

## GitHub Actions

https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/pinact-action

We develop GitHub Actions to pin GitHub Actions and reusable workflows by pinact.

## Configuration

A configuration file is optional.
pinact supports a configuration file `.pinact.yaml`, `.github/pinact.yaml`, `.pinact.yml` or `.github/pinact.yml`.
You can also specify the configuration file path by the environment variable `PINACT_CONFIG` or command line option `-c`.

As of pinact v2.2.0, pinact configuration file has a schema version.

```yaml
version: 3
```

In general, you should use the latest schema version.

### Schema v3 (latest)

pinact v2.2.0 or later supports this version.

.pinact.yaml

e.g.

```yaml
version: 3
files:
  - pattern: .github/workflows/*.yml
  - pattern: .github/workflows/*.yaml
  - pattern: .github/actions/*/action.yml
  - pattern: .github/actions/*/action.yaml

ignore_actions:
  # slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator doesn't support pinning version
  # > Invalid ref: 68bad40844440577b33778c9f29077a3388838e9. Expected ref of the form refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
  # https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/issues/722
  - name: slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_generic_slsa3.yml
    ref: "v\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+"
  - name: suzuki-shunsuke/.*
    ref: main
```

#### `files`

This is optional.
A list of target files.

#### `files[].pattern`

This is required.
A glob pattern of target files.
[Go's path/filepath#Glob](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Glob) is used.
A relative path from pinact's configuration file.
If files are passed via positional command line arguments, the configuration is ignored.

e.g.

```yaml
files:
  - pattern: .github/workflows/*.yml
  - pattern: .github/workflows/*.yaml
  - pattern: README.md
```

#### `ignore_actions`

This is optional. A list of ignored actions and reusable workflows.

#### `ignore_actions[].name`

This is required.
A regular expression of ignored actions and reusable workflows.

```yaml
ignored_actions:
  - name: actions/.*
    ref: main
```

> [!WARNING]
> Regular expressions must match with action names exactly.
> For instance, `name: actions/` doesn't match with `actions/checkout`

Regarding regular expressions, [Go's regexp package is used.](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp)

#### `ignore_actions[].ref`

This is required.
A regular expression of ignored action versions (branch, tag, or commit hash).

> [!WARNING]
> Regular expressions must match with action names exactly.
> For instance, `ref: main` doesn't match with `malicious-main`

### Old Schemas

Please see [here](docs/old_schema.md).

### JSON Schema

- [pinact.json](json-schema/pinact.json)
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suzuki-shunsuke/pinact/refs/heads/main/json-schema/pinact.json

If you look for a CLI tool to validate configuration with JSON Schema, [ajv-cli](https://ajv.js.org/packages/ajv-cli.html) is useful.

```sh
ajv --spec=draft2020 -s json-schema/pinact.json -d pinact.yaml
```

#### Input Complementation by YAML Language Server

[Please see the comment too.](https://github.com/szksh-lab/.github/issues/67#issuecomment-2564960491)

Version: `main`

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suzuki-shunsuke/pinact/main/json-schema/pinact.json
```

Or pinning version:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suzuki-shunsuke/pinact/v1.1.2/json-schema/pinact.json
```

## Q. Why doesn't pinact pin versions?

In some cases pinact doesn't pin versions intentionally, which may confuse you.
So we describe the reason here.

pinact doesn't pin actions whose versions aren't semver (e.g. `main`, `master`, `release/v1`).
This is because pinact is designed as a safe tool so that it doesn't change workflows behaviour.
pinact pins actions but doesn't change SHA of actions at the moment when pinact pins versions.

This design enables you to accept changes by pinact safely.

For instance, pinact changes the version `v1` to `v1.1.0` if their SHA are equivalent.
If there are no semver whose SHA is same with `v1`, pinact doesn't change the version.

And pinact doesn't change versions which aren't semver.
For instance, pinact doesn't change the version `main`.

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@main
```

We don't want to pin `main` to full commit length SHA like the following because we can't update this following semantic versioning.

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@85e6279cec87321a52edac9c87bce653a07cf6c2 # main
```

Tools like Renovate can update the SHA, but it's not safe at all as `main` branch isn't stable.

And we don't want to change `main` to the latest semver like the following because SHA is changed and workflows may be broken.

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # 4.2.2
```

We don't want to pin branches as SHA of branches is changed.

pinact doesn't check if a version is a tag or a branch because we would like to reduce the number of API calls as much as possible.
If a version isn't semver, pinact judges it may be a branch so pinact doesn't pin it.
