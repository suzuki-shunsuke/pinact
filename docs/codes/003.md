# this version was abandoned. Please update the schema version

This error means the schema version of your configuration file `.pinact.yaml` is old, so your pinact doesn't support the version.
You need to update the schema version, or downgrade pinact.
Please use the latest version of pinact and the schema version as much as possible.
Maybe you should update pinact.
You can migrate the configuration file by `pinact migrate` command.

```sh
pinact migrate
```

Please see release notes of major updates too.
