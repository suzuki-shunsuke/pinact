# pinact doesn't support this configuration format version. Maybe you need to update pinact

This error means your pinact doesn't support the schema version of your configuration file `.pinact.yaml`.
Maybe your pinact is old, or the schema version is invalid.

If the schema version is invalid, please fix it.
If your pinact is old, please update it.
